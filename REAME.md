a) Ethan Tucker, Robert Middleton, Brendan Dunning

b) We used the system variables outlined in the slides
    APP_JDBC_USER
    APP_JDBC_PW
    APP_JDBC_URL

c) The only known "bugs" currently are the lack of error catching in almost all of the program. If the user enter invalid data the program will get mad. (If a date is formatted incorrectly or a string is put in for a number...that kind of stuff).
